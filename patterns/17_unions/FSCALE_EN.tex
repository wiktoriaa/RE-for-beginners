\section{FSCALE replacement}
\myindex{x86!\Instructions!FSCALE}

Agner Fog in his \IT{Optimizing subroutines in assembly language / An optimization guide for x86 platforms} work
\footnote{\url{http://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_assembly.pdf}} states that \INS{FSCALE} \ac{FPU} instruction
(calculating $2^n$) may be slow on many CPUs, and he offers faster replacement.

Here is my translation of his assembly code to \CCpp:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/17_unions/FSCALE.c}

\INS{FSCALE} instruction may be faster in your environment, but still, it's a good example of \IT{union}'s and the fact
that exponent is stored in $2^n$ form,
so an input $n$ value is shifted to the exponent in IEEE 754 encoded number.
Then exponent is then corrected with addition of 0x3f800000 or 0x3ff0000000000000.

The same can be done without shift using \IT{struct}, but internally, shift operations still occurred.
