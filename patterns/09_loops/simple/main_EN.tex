\subsubsection{One more thing}

In the generated code we can see: 
after initializing $i$, the body of the loop is not to be executed,
as the condition for $i$ is checked first, and only after that loop body can be executed.
And that is correct. 

Because, if the loop condition is
not met at the beginning, the body of the loop must not be executed.
This is possible in the following case:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/09_loops/simple/loops_3_EN.c}

If \IT{total\_entries\_to\_process} is 0, the body of the loop must not be executed at all.

This is why the condition checked before the execution.

However, an optimizing compiler may swap the condition check and loop body,
if it sure that the situation described here is
not possible (like in the case of our very simple example and using compilers like Keil, Xcode (LLVM), MSVC in optimization mode).
