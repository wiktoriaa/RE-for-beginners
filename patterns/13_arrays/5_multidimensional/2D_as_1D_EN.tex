\subsubsection{Access two-dimensional array as one-dimensional}

We can be easily assured that it's possible to access a two-dimensional array as one-dimensional array in at least two ways:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/13_arrays/5_multidimensional/2D_as_1D_EN.c}

Compile and run it: it shows correct values.

What MSVC 2013 did is fascinating, all three routines are just the same!

GCC also generates equivalent routines, but slightly different:
