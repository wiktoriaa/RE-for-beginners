% FIXME better start at non-optimizing version?

The function uses a lot of S- registers which must be preserved, so that's why its 
values are saved in the function prologue and restored in the epilogue.

Something interesting: there are two loops and the first one doesn't need $i$, it needs only 
$i*2$ (increased by 2 at each iteration) and also the address in memory (increased by 4 at each iteration).

So here we see two variables, one (in \$V0) increasing by 2 each time, and another (in \$V1) --- by 4.

The second loop is where \printf is called and it reports the value of $i$ to the user, 
so there is a variable
which is increased by 1 each time (in \$S0) and also a memory address (in \$S1) increased by 4 each time.

That reminds us of loop optimizations we considered earlier: \myref{loop_iterators}.

Their goal is to get rid of of multiplications.
