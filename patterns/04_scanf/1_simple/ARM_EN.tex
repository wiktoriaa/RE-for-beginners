\myindex{\CLanguageElements!\Pointers}

In order for \scanf to be able to read item it needs a parameter---pointer to an \Tint.
\Tint is 32-bit, so we need 4 bytes to store it somewhere in memory, and it fits exactly in a 32-bit register.
\myindex{IDA!var\_?}
A place for the local variable \GTT{x} is allocated in the stack and \IDA
has named it \IT{var\_8}. It is not necessary, however, to allocate a such since \ac{SP} (\gls{stack pointer}) is already pointing to that space and it can be used directly.

So, \ac{SP}'s value is copied to the \Reg{1} register and, together with the format-string, passed to \scanf.
\myindex{ARM!\Instructions!LDR}
Later, with the help of the \INS{LDR} instruction, this value is moved from the stack to the \Reg{1} register in order to be passed to \printf.

\myparagraph{ARM64}

\lstinputlisting[caption=\NonOptimizing GCC 4.9.1 ARM64,numbers=left,style=customasmARM]{patterns/04_scanf/1_simple/ARM64_GCC491_O0_EN.s}

There is 32 bytes are allocated for stack frame, which is bigger than it needed. Perhaps some memory aligning issue?
The most interesting part is finding space for the $x$ variable in the stack frame (line 22).
Why 28? Somehow, compiler decided to place this variable at the end of stack frame instead of beginning.
The address is passed to \scanf, which just stores the user input value in the memory at that address.
This is 32-bit value of type \Tint.
The value is fetched at line 27 and then passed to \printf.
