\subsubsection{MSVC: x64}

\myindex{x86-64}

Since we work here with \Tint{}-typed variables, which are still 32-bit in x86-64, we see how the 32-bit part of the registers (prefixed with \TT{E-}) are used here as well.
While working with pointers, however, 64-bit register parts are used, prefixed with \TT{R-}.
