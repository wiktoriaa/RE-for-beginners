\subsection{scanf()}

As was noted before, it is slightly old-fashioned to use \scanf today. 
But if we have to, we have to check if \scanf finishes correctly without an error.

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/04_scanf/3_checking_retval/ex3.c}

By standard, the \scanf\footnote{scanf, wscanf: \href{http://go.yurichev.com/17255}{MSDN}} function returns the number of fields it has successfully read.

In our case, if everything goes fine and the user enters a number \scanf returns 1, or in case of error (or \ac{EOF}) --- 0.

Let's add some C code to check the \scanf return value and print error message in case of an error.

This works as expected:

\begin{lstlisting}
C:\...>ex3.exe
Enter X:
123
You entered 123...

C:\...>ex3.exe
Enter X:
ouch
What you entered? Huh?
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{\Exercise}

\myindex{x86!\Instructions!Jcc}
\myindex{ARM!\Instructions!Bcc}
As we can see, the \INS{JNE}/\INS{JNZ} instruction can be easily replaced by the \INS{JE}/\INS{JZ} and vice versa 
(or \INS{BNE} by \INS{BEQ} and vice versa).
But then the basic blocks must also be swapped.
Try to do this in some of the examples.
