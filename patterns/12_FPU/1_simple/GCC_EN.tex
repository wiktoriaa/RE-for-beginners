\myparagraph{GCC}

GCC 4.4.1 (with \Othree option) emits the same code, just slightly different:

\lstinputlisting[caption=\Optimizing GCC 4.4.1,style=customasmx86]{patterns/12_FPU/1_simple/GCC_EN.asm}

The difference is that, first of all, 3.14 is pushed to the stack (into \ST{0}), and then the value 
in \GTT{arg\_0} is divided by the value in \ST{0}.

\myindex{x86!\Instructions!FDIVR}

\FDIVR stands for \IT{Reverse Divide}~---to divide with divisor and dividend swapped with each other. 
There is no likewise instruction for multiplication since it is 
a commutative operation, so we just have \FMUL without its \GTT{-R} counterpart.

\myindex{x86!\Instructions!FADDP}

\FADDP adds the two values but also pops one value from the stack. 
After that operation, \ST{0} holds the sum.
