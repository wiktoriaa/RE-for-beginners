\section{Breaking simple executable cryptor}

I've got an executable file which is encrypted by relatively simple encryption.
\href{https://github.com/dennis714/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/breaking_simple_exec_crypto/files/cipher.bin}{Here is it} (only executable section is left here).

First, all encryption function does is just adds number of position in buffer to the byte.
Here is how this can be encoded in Python:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Python script,style=custompy]
#!/usr/bin/env python
def e(i, k):
    return chr ((ord(i)+k) % 256)

def encrypt(buf):
    return e(buf[0], 0)+ e(buf[1], 1)+ e(buf[2], 2) + e(buf[3], 3)+ e(buf[4], 4)+ e(buf[5], 5)+ e(buf[6], 6)+ e(buf[7], 7)+
           e(buf[8], 8)+ e(buf[9], 9)+ e(buf[10], 10)+ e(buf[11], 11)+ e(buf[12], 12)+ e(buf[13], 13)+ e(buf[14], 14)+ e(buf[15], 15)
\end{lstlisting}

Hence, if you encrypt buffer with 16 zeros, you'll get \IT{0, 1, 2, 3 ... 12, 13, 14, 15}.

\myindex{Propagating Cipher Block Chaining}
Propagating Cipher Block Chaining (PCBC) is also used, here is how it works:

The problem is that it's too boring to recover IV (Initialization Vector) each time.
Brute-force is also not an option, because IV is too long (16 bytes).
Let's see, if it's possible to recover IV for arbitrary encrypted executable file?

Let's try simple frequency analysis.
This is 32-bit x86 executable code, so let's gather statistics about most frequent bytes and opcodes.
I tried huge oracle.exe file from Oracle RDBMS version 11.2 for windows x86 and I've found that the most frequent byte (no surprise) is zero (~10\%).
The next most frequent byte is (again, no surprise) 0xFF (~5\%).
The next is 0x8B (~5\%).

\myindex{x86!\Instructions!MOV}
0x8B is opcode for \INS{MOV}, this is indeed one of the most busy x86 instructions.
Now what about popularity of zero byte?
If compiler needs to encode value bigger than 127, it has to use 32-bit displacement instead of 8-bit one, but large values are very rare,
so it is padded by zeros.
\myindex{x86!\Instructions!LEA}
\myindex{x86!\Instructions!PUSH}
\myindex{x86!\Instructions!CALL}
This is at least in \INS{LEA}, \INS{MOV}, \INS{PUSH}, \INS{CALL}.

For example:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
8D B0 28 01 00 00                 lea     esi, [eax+128h]
8D BF 40 38 00 00                 lea     edi, [edi+3840h]
\end{lstlisting}

Displacements bigger than 127 are very popular, but they are rarely exceeds 0x10000
(indeed, such large memory buffers/structures are also rare).

Same story with \INS{MOV}, large constants are rare, the most heavily used are 0, 1, 10, 100, $2^n$, and so on.
Compiler has to pad small constants by zeros to represent them as 32-bit values:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
BF 02 00 00 00                    mov     edi, 2
BF 01 00 00 00                    mov     edi, 1
\end{lstlisting}

Now about 00 and FF bytes combined: jumps (including conditional) and calls can pass execution flow forward or backwards, but very often,
within the limits of the current executable module.
If forward, displacement is not very big and also padded with zeros.
If backwards, displacement is represented as negative value, so padded with FF bytes.
For example, transfer execution flow forward:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
E8 43 0C 00 00                    call    _function1
E8 5C 00 00 00                    call    _function2
0F 84 F0 0A 00 00                 jz      loc_4F09A0
0F 84 EB 00 00 00                 jz      loc_4EFBB8
\end{lstlisting}

Backwards:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
E8 79 0C FE FF                    call    _function1
E8 F4 16 FF FF                    call    _function2
0F 84 F8 FB FF FF                 jz      loc_8212BC
0F 84 06 FD FF FF                 jz      loc_FF1E7D
\end{lstlisting}

FF byte is also very often occurred in negative displacements like these:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
8D 85 1E FF FF FF                 lea     eax, [ebp-0E2h]
8D 95 F8 5C FF FF                 lea     edx, [ebp-0A308h]
\end{lstlisting}

So far so good. Now we have to try various 16-byte keys, decrypt executable section and measure how often 00, FF ad 8B bytes are occurred.
Let's also keep in sight how PCBC decryption works:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\myincludegraphics{examples/simple_exec_crypto/640px-PCBC_decryption.svg.png}
\caption{Propagating Cipher Block Chaining decryption (image is taken from Wikipedia article)}
\end{figure}

The good news is that we don't really have to decrypt whole piece of data, but only slice by slice, this is exactly how I did in my previous example: \myref{XOR_mask_2}.

Now I'm trying all possible bytes (0..255) for each byte in key and just pick the byte producing maximal amount of 00/FF/8B bytes in a decrypted slice:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=custompy]
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys, hexdump, array, string, operator

KEY_LEN=16

def chunks(l, n):
    # split n by l-byte chunks
    # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/312443/how-do-you-split-a-list-into-evenly-sized-chunks-in-python
    n = max(1, n)
    return [l[i:i + n] for i in range(0, len(l), n)]

def read_file(fname):
    file=open(fname, mode='rb')
    content=file.read()
    file.close()
    return content

def decrypt_byte (c, key):
    return chr((ord(c)-key) % 256)

def XOR_PCBC_step (IV, buf, k):
    prev=IV
    rt=""
    for c in buf:
	new_c=decrypt_byte(c, k)
        plain=chr(ord(new_c)^ord(prev))
	prev=chr(ord(c)^ord(plain))
	rt=rt+plain
    return rt

each_Nth_byte=[""]*KEY_LEN

content=read_file(sys.argv[1])
# split input by 16-byte chunks:
all_chunks=chunks(content, KEY_LEN)
for c in all_chunks:
    for i in range(KEY_LEN):
        each_Nth_byte[i]=each_Nth_byte[i] + c[i]

# try each byte of key
for N in range(KEY_LEN):
    print "N=", N
    stat={}
    for i in range(256):
        tmp_key=chr(i)
	tmp=XOR_PCBC_step(tmp_key,each_Nth_byte[N], N)
        # count 0, FFs and 8Bs in decrypted buffer:
	important_bytes=tmp.count('\x00')+tmp.count('\xFF')+tmp.count('\x8B')
	stat[i]=important_bytes
    sorted_stat = sorted(stat.iteritems(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)
    print sorted_stat[0]
\end{lstlisting}

(Source code can downloaded \href{https://github.com/dennis714/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/breaking_simple_exec_crypto/files/decrypt.py}{here}.)

I run it and here is a key for which 00/FF/8B bytes presence in decrypted buffer is maximal:

\begin{lstlisting}
N= 0
(147, 1224)
N= 1
(94, 1327)
N= 2
(252, 1223)
N= 3
(218, 1266)
N= 4
(38, 1209)
N= 5
(192, 1378)
N= 6
(199, 1204)
N= 7
(213, 1332)
N= 8
(225, 1251)
N= 9
(112, 1223)
N= 10
(143, 1177)
N= 11
(108, 1286)
N= 12
(10, 1164)
N= 13
(3, 1271)
N= 14
(128, 1253)
N= 15
(232, 1330)
\end{lstlisting}

Let's write decryption utility with the key we got:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=custompy]
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys, hexdump, array

def xor_strings(s,t):
    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher#Example_implementation
    """xor two strings together"""
    return "".join(chr(ord(a)^ord(b)) for a,b in zip(s,t))

IV=array.array('B', [147, 94, 252, 218, 38, 192, 199, 213, 225, 112, 143, 108, 10, 3, 128, 232]).tostring()

def chunks(l, n):
    n = max(1, n)
    return [l[i:i + n] for i in range(0, len(l), n)]

def read_file(fname):
    file=open(fname, mode='rb')
    content=file.read()
    file.close()
    return content

def decrypt_byte(i, k):
    return chr ((ord(i)-k) % 256)

def decrypt(buf):
    return "".join(decrypt_byte(buf[i], i) for i in range(16))

fout=open(sys.argv[2], mode='wb')

prev=IV
content=read_file(sys.argv[1])
tmp=chunks(content, 16)
for c in tmp:
    new_c=decrypt(c)
    p=xor_strings (new_c, prev)
    prev=xor_strings(c, p)
    fout.write(p)
fout.close()
\end{lstlisting}

(Source code can downloaded \href{https://github.com/dennis714/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/breaking_simple_exec_crypto/files/decrypt2.py}{here}.)

Let's check resulting file:

\lstinputlisting{examples/simple_exec_crypto/objdump_result.txt}

Yes, this is seems correctly disassembled piece of x86 code.
The whole dectyped file can be downloaded \href{https://github.com/dennis714/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/breaking_simple_exec_crypto/files/decrypted.bin}{here}.

In fact, this is text section from regedit.exe from Windows 7.
But this example is based on a real case I encountered, so just executable is different (and key), algorithm is the same.

\subsection{Other ideas to consider}

What if I would fail with such simple frequency analysis?
There are other ideas on how to measure correctness of decrypted/decompressed x86 code:

\begin{itemize}

\item Many modern compilers aligns functions on 0x10 border.
So the space left before is filled with NOPs (0x90) or other NOP instructions with known opcodes: \myref{sec:npad}.

\item Perhaps, the most frequent pattern in any assembly language is function call:\\
\TT{PUSH chain / CALL / ADD ESP, X}.
This sequence can easily detected and found.
I've even gathered statistics about average number of function arguments: \myref{args_stat}.
(Hence, this is average length of PUSH chain.)

\end{itemize}

By the way, 
it is interesting to know that the fact that function calls (\PUSH/\CALL/\ADD) and \MOV instructions are the most frequently executed pieces of code in almost all
programs we use.
In other words, CPU is very busy passing information between levels of abstractions, or, it can be said, it's very busy switching between these levels.
This is a cost of splitting problems into several levels of abstractions.
