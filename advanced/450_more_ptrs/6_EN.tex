\subsection{Pointer to function}

A function name in \CCpp without brackets, like ``printf'' is a pointer to function of \IT{void (*)()} type.
Let's try to read function's contents and patch it:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{advanced/450_more_ptrs/6.c}

It tells, that the first 3 bytes of functions are \TT{55 89 e5}.
Indeed, these are opcodes of \INS{PUSH EBP} and \INS{MOV EBP, ESP} instructions (these are x86 opcodes).
But then our program crashes, because \IT{text} section is readonly.

We can recompile our example and make \IT{text} section writable
\footnote{\url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27581279/make-text-segment-writable-elf}}:

\begin{lstlisting}
gcc --static -g -Wl,--omagic -o example example.c
\end{lstlisting}

That works!

\begin{lstlisting}
we are in print_something()
first 3 bytes: 55 89 e5...
going to call patched print_something():
it must exit at this point
\end{lstlisting}
