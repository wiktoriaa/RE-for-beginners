\subsection{References}

\label{cpp_references}

In \Cpp, references are pointers (\myref{label_pointers}) as well, but they are called \IT{safe}, because it is harder to make a mistake while
dealing with them (C++11 8.3.2). % FIXME link

For example, reference must always be pointing to an object of the corresponding type and cannot be NULL
\InSqBrackets{\ParashiftCPPFAQ 8.6}.

Even more than that, references cannot be changed, it is impossible to point them to another object (reseat)
\InSqBrackets{\ParashiftCPPFAQ 8.5}.

If we are going to try to change the example with pointers (\myref{label_pointers}) 
to use references instead \dots

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
void f2 (int x, int y, int & sum, int & product)
{
	sum=x+y;
	product=x*y;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\dots then we can see that the compiled code is just the same 
as in the pointers example (\myref{label_pointers}):

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=\Optimizing MSVC 2010,style=customasmx86]
_x$ = 8		; size = 4
_y$ = 12	; size = 4
_sum$ = 16	; size = 4
_product$ = 20	; size = 4
?f2@@YAXHHAAH0@Z PROC	; f2
	mov	ecx, DWORD PTR _y$[esp-4]
	mov	eax, DWORD PTR _x$[esp-4]
	lea	edx, DWORD PTR [eax+ecx]
	imul eax, ecx
	mov ecx, DWORD PTR _product$[esp-4]
	push esi
	mov	esi, DWORD PTR _sum$[esp]
	mov	DWORD PTR [esi], edx
	mov	DWORD PTR [ecx], eax
	pop	esi
	ret	0
?f2@@YAXHHAAH0@Z ENDP	; f2
\end{lstlisting}

(The reason why \Cpp functions has such strange names is explained here: \myref{namemangling}.)

Hence, C++ references are as much efficient as usual pointers.
