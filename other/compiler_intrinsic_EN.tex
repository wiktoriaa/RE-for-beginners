\myindex{x86!\Instructions!ROR}

A function specific to a compiler which is not an usual library function.
The compiler generates a specific machine code instead of a call to it.
It is often a pseudofunction for specific \ac{CPU} instruction. \\
\\
For example, there are no cyclic shift operations in \CCpp languages, but they are present in most \ac{CPU}s.
For programmer's convenience, at least MSVC has pseudofunctions
\IT{\_rotl()} and \IT{\_rotr()}\FNMSDNROTxURL{}
which are translated by the compiler directly to the ROL/ROR x86 instructions. \\
\\
Another example are functions to generate SSE-instructions right in the code.
