\section*{Preface}

There are several popular meanings of the term \q{\gls{reverse engineering}}:
1) The reverse engineering of software: researching compiled programs;
2) The scanning of 3D structures and the subsequent digital manipulation required in order to duplicate them;
3) Recreating \ac{DBMS} structure.
This book is about the first meaning.

This is the A5-format version for e-book readers.
Although the content is mostly the same, the illustrations are resized and probably not readable.
You may try to change scale in your e-book reader.
Otherwise, you can always view them in the A4-format version here:

\subsection*{About the Korean translation}

In January 2015, the Acorn publishing company (\href{http://www.acornpub.co.kr}{www.acornpub.co.kr}) in South Korea did a huge amount of work in translating and publishing 
my book (as it was in August 2014) into Korean.

It's now available at \href{http://go.yurichev.com/17343}{their website}.

The translator is Byungho Min (\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17344}{twitter/tais9}).
The cover art was done by my artistic friend, Andy Nechaevsky:
\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17023}{facebook/andydinka}.
They also hold the copyright to the Korean translation.

So, if you want to have a \IT{real} book on your shelf in Korean and 
want to support my work, it is now available for purchase.
